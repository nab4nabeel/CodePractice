Q3. Time Complexity - 9

What is the time complexity of the following code snippet?

int i = 0;
while(i*i <= N){
   for(int j = 0; j <= N; j++){
      for(int k = 0; k <= N; k++,i++){
         //O(1) operation
      }
   }
   i++;
}

Ans: O(N^2)


Complete Solution

The nested for loop will have time complexity of O(N^2) and as during the loop run it also increments the variable i greater sqrt(N) the while will stop after the nested loop stops.Hence final time complexity will be O(N^2)


Hence i will be greater than n after for loops are executed as in k loop i is also incremented
