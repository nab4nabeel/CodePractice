Q4. Time Complexity-iii

What is the time complexity of the following code snippet?

for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){

    for(int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j++){

            ans += i + j ;

    }

}

Ans: Code will run indefinitely

Complete solution

Since the end of the loop is set 0 and its start is i-1 and variable j is increased rather than decreasing , j will always be greater or equal to 0
