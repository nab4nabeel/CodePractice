Q1. Time Complexity - 10

What is the time complexity of the following code snippet?


for (int i = 3 ; i < n / 3  ;  i += 3) {
    for(int j = 2 ; j < n / 2 ; j += 2){
        // O(1) operation  
    }
}

Ans: O(n^2)


Complete Solution

Even though the first loop is increased by 3 and ends at n/3 ,and the inner loop is incresed by 2 and end at n/2 , the big-O runtime doenâ€™t consider constants . Hence the overall time complexity will be O(N^2)
