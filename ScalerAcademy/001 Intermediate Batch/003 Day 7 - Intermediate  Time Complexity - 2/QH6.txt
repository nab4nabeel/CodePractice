Q6. Time Complexity Easy 01


What is the Time Complexity of following snippet ?

int count =0;
while(N){
    count++;
    N/=3;
}

Ans: O(log(N)) {Base 3}


Complete Solution

We have to find k such that,
N/(3^k) = 0
We will approx it to, N/(3^k) = 1
Or, N = 3^k
Taking log we will get k=logN where base is 3.
