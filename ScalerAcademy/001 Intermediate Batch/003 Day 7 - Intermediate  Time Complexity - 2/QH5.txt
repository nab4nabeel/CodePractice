Q5. Time Complexity Easy 02

What is the Time Complexity of following snippet ?

for (i = 0; i < N; i++) { 
  for (j = i; j < N; j++) { 
     break; 
  }
}


Ans: O(N)


Solution Approach

The inner loop is not running completely. So complexity will depend on the outer one.



Complete Solution

Here for every i the inner loop will run for only one iteration as we have break out of inner loop. So the complexity is the number of times outer loop will run.
That is N so complexity is O(N).
