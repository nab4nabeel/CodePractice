Q2. Time Complexity - 3

What will be the Time Complexity of the given code?

public void solve() {
    int i = 1;
    while (i < n) {
        int x = i;
        while (x--> 0) {
            //O(1) operation
        }
        i++;
    }
}


Ans: O(n^2)


The total number of operations taking place is the sum of first n natural numbers, which is equal to n * (n + 1) / 2.
Therefore, the time complexity is O(n2).
